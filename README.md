This tool allows to calculate the center of gravity of an element or of the set of elements; essential data if we want to carry out a lifting study.

Once the plugin is installed, the **JDS** tab will appear in Revit which contains this and all the author's solutions.

To see the plugin in action take a look at the video below.
